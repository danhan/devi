# Set Devi Install Directory
# ------------------------------

# The Devi install directory is set by the ``DEST`` variable. By setting it
# early in ``localrc`` you can reference it in later variables. The default value
# is ``/opt/savi``. It can be useful to set it even though it is not changed from
# the default value.
# Set Devi Install Directory
DEST=$HOME/savi

# Set git user name in savinetwork.ca
GIT_USERNAME=eliot
